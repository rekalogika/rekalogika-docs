A dimension hierarchy is a way to organize dimensions in a hierarchical
structure. For example, you can have a hierarchy of time dimensions, where each
level represents a different granularity of time, such as year, month, and day.

In Analytics, a dimension hierarchy is modeled using a Doctrine embeddable.
