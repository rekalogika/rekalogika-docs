description: Explains how to use the reconstitutor library.

Because everyone knows about file uploads, we are going to use it as an
example, even if you probably won't use this framework as a means for handling
file uploads.

:::info Shameless Plug

We also provide [`rekalogika/file-bundle`](../file-bundle) framework that
handles file uploads and so much more. It also utilizes this library behind the
scenes.

## Reconstitution of a Class

This will apply to objects that are instances of a specific class, subclasses
of a specific class, or implement a specific interface.

Suppose you have an `Order` object that stores a payment receipt in the
`paymentReceipt` property:

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File;
use Symfony\Component\Uid\UuidV7;

class Order
{
    private string $id;
    private ?File $paymentReceipt = null;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->id = new UuidV7;
    }

    public function getId(): string
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function getPaymentReceipt(): ?File
    {
        return $this->paymentReceipt;
    }

    public function setPaymentReceipt(File $paymentReceipt): void
    {
        $this->paymentReceipt = $paymentReceipt;
    }
}
```

:::note

In the above class, Doctrine related attributes are omitted for brevity.

:::

During the fetching of the object from the database, Doctrine will instantiate
the object and hydrate `$id` and other properties that it manages. Afterward, it
will be our reconstitutor's turn to handle the `$paymentReceipt` property.
Similar things also happen when the object is persisted to the database, or
removed.

```php
use Rekalogika\Reconstitutor\AbstractClassReconstitutor;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile;

/**
 * @extends AbstractClassReconstitutor<Order>
 */
final class OrderReconstitutor extends AbstractClassReconstitutor
{
    /**
     * The class that this reconstitutor manages. It can also be a super class
     * or an interface.
     */
    public static function getClass(): string
    {
        return Order::class;
    }

    /**
     * When the object is being saved, we check if the paymentReceipt has been
     * just uploaded. If it is, we save it to a file.
     * 
     * Note: in Symfony, an uploaded file is represented by an instance of
     * `UploadedFile`, otherwise it will be a `File` object.
     */
    public function onSave(object $order): void
    {
        $path = sprintf('/tmp/payment_receipt/%s', $order->getId());

        $file = $this->get($order, 'paymentReceipt');

        if ($file instanceof UploadedFile) {
            file_put_contents($path, $file->getContent());
            $this->set($order, 'paymentReceipt', new File($path));
        }
    }

    /**
     * When the object is being loaded from the database, we check if the
     * supposed payment receipt is already saved. If it is, then we load the
     * file to the property.
     */
    public function onLoad(object $order): void
    {
        $path = sprintf('/tmp/payment_receipt/%s', $order->getId());

        if (file_exists($path)) {
            $file = new File($path);
        } else {
            $file = null;
        }

        $this->set($order, 'paymentReceipt', $file);
    }

    /**
     * If the order is being removed, we remove the associated payment receipt
     * here.
     */
    public function onRemove(object $order): void
    {
        $path = sprintf('/tmp/payment_receipt/%s', $order->getId());

        if (file_exists($path)) {
            unlink($path);
        }
    }
}
```

## Reconstitution of Classes With a Specific PHP Attribute

Alternatively, you can also target classes with a specific PHP attribute. The
following modifies above example to use an attribute for targeting.

The entity class:

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File;
use Symfony\Component\Uid\UuidV7;

// highlight-next-line
#[MyAttribute]
class Order
{
    // ...
}
```

And the reconstitutor class:

```php
use Rekalogika\Reconstitutor\AbstractAttributeReconstitutor;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File;

final class OrderReconstitutor extends AbstractAttributeReconstitutor
{
    /**
     * If the object has this attribute, then we are going to handle it.
     */
    // highlight-start
    public static function getAttributeClass(): string
    {
        return MyAttribute::class;
    }
    // highlight-end

    public function onSave(object $order): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function onLoad(object $order): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function onRemove(object $order): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## `get()` and `set()` Helpers

In reconstitution, you should get and set the object's properties directly,
bypassing the getters and setters, just like what Doctrine does. To help you
with that, the abstract classes provide the `get()` and `set()` helpers.

These are just forwarders to our custom implementation of the familiar Symfony
PropertyAccess (see [rekalogika/direct-property-access](../direct-property-access)
for more information). Therefore, you can catch the same exceptions as you would
when using the original Symfony PropertyAccess.

## Caveat: Avoid `Query::toIterable`

Doctrine's documentation [recommends using
`Query::toIterable()`](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/batch-processing.html#iterating-results)
to iterate over large result sets. However, using `Query::toIterable()` may
[prevent the triggering of the `postLoad` event
handlers](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/events.html#postload),
and may prevent our reconstitutors from working correctly.

We recommend using our `rekalogika/rekapager` package instead. Read more in our
[batch processing](/rekapager/batch-processing) documentation.
