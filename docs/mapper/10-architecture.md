This chapter describes the architecture of the library.

![Mapper](./diagrams/mapper.light.svg#light)
![Mapper](./diagrams/mapper.dark.svg#dark)

## Main Components

### Mapper Factory

Creates the mapper service. Only used in non-framework usage.

### Mapper

A fa√ßade for the entire mapping framework. A user-facing interface that is used
directly by the caller. It provides a convenient, typed interface, for the
caller, and forwards the call to the main transformer.

### Main Transformer

The main transformer is the entry point of the library. It is responsible
for finding the transformer that supports the source to target mapping,
and forwards the task to that transformer.

### Transformer Registry <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

A registry of the transformers. It is used by the main transformer to find
the matching transformer for the specific source and target types.

### Object Cache Factory <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

An object cache stores the objects that have been mapped, keyed by the source
object and the target type. This is used to handle circular references. The
object cache factory creates such object caches.

### Mapping Factory <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Creates the mapping table from the list of the transformers.

The mapping table is a list of the supported source to target type, mapped to
the transformer suitable for the task. It is used by `TransformerRegistry` to
find the correct transformer for transforming the source to the target type.

### Transformer

Transforms a source variable to the target variable. A transformer class
provides the list of the supported source to target mappings, as well as
the logic for transforming the source to the target.

## Components Used by Transformers

### Object to Object Metadata Factory <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Creates the metadata for `ObjectToObjectTransformer`. The metadata provides all
the information it needs to do the mapping between two objects.

### Symfony Property Info <Badge type="info">Third-party</Badge>

The library uses the Symfony Property Info component to list the properties of
the source and target variables, and to query their types. This library uses
the `Type` objects returned by the Symfony Property Info component as the
means of describing the types of the source and target variables.

### Property Mapper

A custom, user-provided method that maps a single property from the source to
the target.

### Property Mapper Resolver <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Used to determine if a property mapper is available for a specific source and
target property pair.

### Eager Properties Resolver

Inspect a class and determine the properties that can be mapped eagerly, without
triggering the hydration of the object. As such, this is only applicable to
source objects that are proxy, like Doctrine proxies. The user may create a new
implementation for determining the eager properties of a specific class.

### Proxy Registry <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Register a proxy class, and save it to the filesystem.

### Proxy Generator

Generates the source code of a proxy class.

The user may decorate `ProxyGeneratorInterface` and throw
`ProxyNotSupportedException` to disable proxying for a specific target class.

### Array Like Metadata Factory <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Creates the metadata for `TraversableToArrayAccessTransformer` and
`TraversableToTraversableTransformer`. The metadata provides all the information
it needs to do the mapping between two arrays or array-like objects.

### Object Mapper

A custom, user-provided methods for mapping a specific object pair.

### Object Mapper Resolver <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Obtains an object mapper for a specific source and target object pair.

### Object Mapper Table Factory <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Constructs the object mapper table from all the available object mappers in the
system.

### Symfony Serializer <Badge type="info">Third-party</Badge>

Transforms objects to arrays and back.

### SubMapper Factory <Badge type="danger">Internal</Badge>

Creates a `SubMapper` instance.

### Symfony PropertyAccess <Badge type="info">Third-party</Badge>

Reads and writes the properties of an object.
