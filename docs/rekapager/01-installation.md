You need to install the integration package for the framework you are using.
Currently, there are [Symfony
integration](05-framework-integration/01-symfony.md) and [API Platform
integration](05-framework-integration/02-api-platform.md).

Then, [install one or more adapters](adapters) that you need for
your project.

If you are using this library only for batch processing, then installing only
the adapters you need is sufficient.
