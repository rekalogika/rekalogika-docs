import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This chapter describes how to easily create a form for uploading files.

## Features

* Uses [FilePond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/) in the frontend, and [Symfony
  Form](https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html) in the backend.
* DX improvement. Simply add a field to your form using `FilePondType` or
  `FilePondCollectionType` and you get file upload, image preview, file removal,
  and all the other features.
* To upload, users can browse the files, use drag and drop, or copy & paste
  them.
* Looks nice out of the box.
* No need to write any JavaScript code. Options are supplied using HTML
  attributes.
* Upload files along with the other properties of your entity, no need to create
  a separate form, controller, or logic just for uploading files and removing
  them.
* Localization support. Automatically detects the user's locale and displays
  messages in the correct language.
* Image preview of uploaded files & images. Also shows the preview for
  previously uploaded files when editing an entity.
* To delete the file, users can use the remove button on the preview and submit the form.
* Ships with the kitchen sink. Includes all the plugins that can be configured
  without Javascript, and all the available locales.

## Installation

Preinstallation checklists:

* Make sure Composer is installed globally, as explained in the [installation
chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) of the Composer documentation.
* Make sure you have
[StimulusBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/StimulusBundle/current/index.html)
configured in your app.
* Make sure your project has Symfony Flex installed and enabled (it is enabled
  by default).

Open a command console, enter your project directory, and execute:

```bash
composer require rekalogika/file-filepond
```

If you're using WebpackEncore, install your assets and restart Encore (not
needed if you're using AssetMapper):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn install --force
yarn watch
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install --force
npm run watch
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage for a Single File Property

Simply add your field to your form, using the form type `FilePondType`. Example:

```php
use Rekalogika\File\Bridge\FilePond\FilePondType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

class MyFormType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void
    {
        $builder
            // ...
            ->add('image', FilePondType::class, [
                'label' => 'Product Image',
                'required' => false,
                'attr' => [
                    'accept' => 'image/png, image/jpeg'
                ],
                'allow_delete' => true,
            ])
        ;
    }
}
```

If `allow_delete` is true, then the file will be removed on form submission if
the user removes the file using the remove button on the preview.

## Usage for a Collection of Files

First, you need to set up the relation in your entity like what is described in
[Implementing a Collection of Files](collection). Then you can use
`FilePondCollectionType`. Example:

```php
use Rekalogika\File\Bridge\FilePond\FilePondCollectionType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

class MyFormType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void
    {
        $builder
            // ...
            ->add('images', FilePondCollectionType::class, [
                'label' => 'Product Images',
                'required' => false,
                'attr' => [
                    'accept' => 'image/png, image/jpeg'
                ],
                'allow_delete' => true,
            ]);
        ;
    }
}
```

If `allow_delete` is true, then the file will be removed on form submission if
the user removes the file using the remove button on the preview.

## Specifying Options

You can specify FilePond options using the `attr` option of the form field. The
example below will disable replacing files.

```php
    ->add('image', FilePondType::class, [
        'attr' => [
            'data-allow-replace' => 'false'
        ],
    ])
```

The list of available options can be found in the [FilePond
properties](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/)
documentation.

To specify the option, you need to convert from camelCase to kebab-case, and
prefix the property name with `data-`. For example, the property `allowReplace`
becomes `data-allow-replace`.

We also use several plugins that add additional options. You can read the
[documentation of each of the
plugins](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/) to see what options are
available.

This is the list of the enabled plugins:

* File Encode
* File Metadata
* File Poster
* File ValidateSize
* File ValidateType
* Image Crop
* Image Edit
* Image ExifOrientation
* Image Preview
* Image Resize
* Image Transform
* Image ValidateSize
